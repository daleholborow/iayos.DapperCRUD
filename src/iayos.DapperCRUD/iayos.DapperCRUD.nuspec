		<description>
			A clone+mod of Dapper.SimpleCRUD (some private static methods caused issues), that adds strongly typed selectors
			by using reflection over DB Entity classes (for better, compile-time error checking rather than more problematic use
			of anonymous conditions)
			Author not affiliated with Dapper.SimpleCRUD in any way, but shout outs to Eric for his work (and great doco)! 
			This package not does this come with any warranty. Contributions welcome.
